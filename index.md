## About

I am a forth year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, broadly interested in automated reasoning, formal verification, and AI for theorem proving. In my spare time, I like to play video games, watch Anime, play flight simulators, and do
a small size trading. I am currently applying to graduate programs in computer science and hope to continue working at the intersection of proof automation, formal methods, and machine learning.

## Research

I am pleasured to work under Dr. [Kaiyu Yang](https://yangky11.github.io/) guidance on building LLM-based infrastructure and automated theorem prover for cross-system theorem proving in Lean, Coq, and Isabelle. I also work with Prof. [Venkatesan Guruswami](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~venkatg/) on a Lean library that formalizes core results in coding and information theory and related areas of theoretical computer science. In parallel, I am in Prof. [Ulrike Malmendier](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~ulrike/) URAP team on behavioral-economics projects that use large-scale text, ML/NLP methods to study how lifetime experiences shape economic decisions.
